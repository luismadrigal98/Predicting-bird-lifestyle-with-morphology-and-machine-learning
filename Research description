# Predicting-bird-lifestyle-with-morphology-and-machine-learning

This repository contains code to reproduce the analysis from the paper "Assessing the predictive value of morphological traits on the primary lifestyle of birds through the extreme gradient boosting algorithm" by Luis Javier Madrigal-Roca.

The paper evaluates whether categories of primary lifestyle are suitable for splitting birds based on shared morphological characteristics. It trains machine learning models using the extreme gradient boosting algorithm xgboost to classify over 11,000 bird species into aerial, aquatic, terrestrial, insessorial, or generalist categories based on 11 morphological traits.

The analysis steps include:

Data cleaning and preparation
Univariate analyses to explore individual trait differences
Principal components analysis for dimensionality reduction
Correlation analysis to detect highly collinear variables
Training three models with different variable sets
10-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
Assessing and comparing model accuracy and performance

The best model achieved 84% accuracy in predicting primary lifestyle. The paper provides evidence that primary lifestyle can be predicted from morphology and evaluates the utility of these ecological categories for birds.

The R script performs the full analysis pipeline - data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, xgboost modeling, and model evaluation. It is well commented to serve as a case study in applying machine learning to ecological inference tasks.

The raw data is from the AVONET project (Tobias et al. 2022, Ecology Letters). It contains morphological measurements for nearly all extant bird species.
